Steps to debug issues with these selinux rules:

1. Do a test run (setting up a cluster) with the ceph-installer package.

2. Note whether this run succeeds or fails (do the services start up? does
   ansible-playbook run? etc.)

3. If there are failures, you can see them with:

   sudo audit2allow -a -w

4. Create a local custom policy to allow the failures:

   sudo audit2allow -a -M installer && cat installer.te && sudo semodule -i installer.pp

   ... and then retry the HTTP requests to the API, seeing what breaks next.
   Keep repeating this command until you've built up a policy in the local
   installer.te that you can incorporate into the ceph_installer.te file in
   this directory.
